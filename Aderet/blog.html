          </div>

        <div class = "blog-content">

        
         
          <p>2020 is over (thankfully) and we are ready for a new year, and to turn over a new leaf. Most people use this time to make New Year’s Resolutions and these are typically related to exercise and diet. As a dietitian I encourage you to make these resolutions! It’s important to our long-term health that we stay focused on the food we eat and the activities we partake in. 
            But by February most of the steam for our resolutions begin to fade and only reginite when the weather gets warmer, and we are wearing less layers. So if you choose this new year to embark on a healthier lifestyle, what is going to motivate you? </p>
          

            <p>First step in behavior change is motivation. This is a key ingredient in making any change whether that’s fitness, food, or taking on any new project/endeavor. <strong>Start by writing down the reasons for choosing this resolution.</strong>
               It could be anything from weight loss to getting healthier to taking on a new hobby. Maybe it’s not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. Whatever it may be, recognize it and jot it down. Keep these reasons posted somewhere, whether on a bulletin board at home or a note in your phone, a place where you can access them easily if you need. You can always come back and review this list, change it, or add to it. We are more likely to do the things that mean something to us, so find meaning behind your resolution. 
            </p>
          
            <p> Here are some thoughts to get you started on working out your workouts. </p>
  
          
          <img src="./images/resolutions.png">
          

          <p>You may have seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/well/move/to-lose-weight-with-exercise-aim-for-300-minutes-a-week.html">this article</a> recently discussing exercise and weight loss. There is this basic notion that if we workout we will lose weight and not worry about what we eat or how much. Or that if I went for a run today, it’s okay to eat an extra slice of pizza. Yes, balance and moderation are key to health and nutrition, but there’s more to it when it comes to fitness. We associate losing weight with diet and exercise, and I am not saying exercise isn’t vital but if you are simply out to cut the numbers on the scale, then cutting calories will do the trick. However if we are looking at it from the point of a lifestyle change, our overall health and well-being, then the focus becomes physical activity and smart food choices. </p>

          <p>We know the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm">benefits of exercise</a> - better night’s sleep, heart health, reduce risk of diabetes and some cancers, improve muscle and bone strength, maintain weight and increase life longevity - and to get the most out of our physical activity we want to pair it with good eating. <a href="https://www.self.com/story/what-a-registered-dietitian-says-you-should-eat-before-and-after-a-workout">There are rules</a> when it comes to what foods to eat and liquids to drink before, during, and after a workout depending on the activity and rigor. And these rules are important especially if you are a dedicated athlete. But in the end the rules are similar to the basic healthy eating structure. Enjoy the food you eat, remember that food is for fuel, choose lean proteins, whole grains, load up on fruits and veggies, and drink lots of water! Be good to your body. If you are eating poorly but working out, you are walking up a down escalator. </p>
           
          <p>We covered the WHY, now let’s talk about the HOW. 
          </p>

          <p>One silver lining of the pandemic (there are so few) is the reduction in travel that has resulted in fewer emissions that usually accompany driving and such, and the encouragement of staying at home. We aren’t going to the gym anymore and we are being forced to find ways to stay active in the confines of where we are. Which may not sound like an upside, but if we can keep ourselves healthy and reduce our need to travel, and in turn reduce our carbon footprint, we can flip this into a positive! Workouts don’t have to mean running, biking, and swimming. They can, but thanks to many fitness trainers we’re lucky to have many options for fitness these days that are accessible and fun from home. Some may cost more in terms of subscription and/or equipment but many are free and can provide the benefits of something more expensive. In addition to home workout videos for cardio, strength, and mobility, I have added in taking a 30-40 minute walk to my days. Walking outside is a mood booster and a chance to spend time in nature. </p>
        
          <p>Time is the most difficult hurdle to overcome when it comes to fitness. Finding time and energy in your day to put in a 30-60 minute workout is tough and requires dedication. I can’t tell people how to use their time however if you make physical activity part of your routine it becomes easier and easier to squeeze it in to your day. When you think of your resolutions it’s best to <strong>think of it as a one day or one week at a time kind of thing,</strong> instead of months or years. Because life can be unpredictable and goals should be attainable, <strong>create a flexible plan</strong> that has you working smarter not harder and looking forward to your workout. </p>
          <p>Exercise is more than just the physical aspects. Although we are unfortunately swamped with photos on social media of the “ideal” body type, the truth is that being thin or being toned is not what defines healthy. This is easier said than done but don’t compare yourself to what you see in the media, it’s fruitless and never yields the results you want. Rather, <strong>think of exercise as self-care for your mind and body.</strong></p>
          <p>
            I have struggled with my own body image since I was a Tween. I am not naturally thin, I was never much for athletics, I am definitely lazy by nature and have had to push myself very hard to find an exercise routine that I enjoy and I am consistent with. But as an adult I have found that <strong>I don’t need to run marathons, that regular moderate physical activity can provide a benefit of feeling good, energized, and staying healthy.</strong> A few years ago I was in between jobs and I started going to free yoga classes. It began with 3 times a week and grew to a daily habit. I could not stand skipping even just one day. I learned that the key to consistently working out is finding something you enjoy. If you don’t like it, you won’t stick to it. Simple as that. </p>
          <p>This may sound cheesy but yoga allowed me to connect with my body in a more positive way, and be less obsessed with what I saw in the mirror or in a photo, and in my opinion, we could all do with less concern about what’s on the outside. It made me appreciate its capacity and abilities. So working out stopped being a burden and a chore but something I could physically feel was good for me and that I wanted to keep doing, consistently. I do still practice yoga and I have now incorporated strength training, HIIT, and mobility into my routine with <a href="https://tv.le-sweat.com/">Le Sweat</a>. It took me years to build up to where I am at now, a lot of trial and error, and a heaping tablespoon of patience. Now I can’t imagine life without daily fitness and putting on a bathing suit is not as dreadful as it once was. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. 
          </p>  
          <p>There is more to say on the topic of fitness and nutrition, and I hope to write more that covers the scientific nuances and benefits of working out. This is only a start and a way to think about fitness as more than something superficial. I will end with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/style/self-care/isolation-exercise-meditation-coronavirus.html">this article</a>
             from the NY Times at the start of pandemic that provides tips to stay moving and stresses the importance of self-care. </p>

              <h2 id="recipes-by-season">Recipes by the Season</h2>
              <p>November 16, 2020</p>
            </div>

          <div class = "blog-content">
            <p>
              You may have noticed my recipes are missing the classic GF (gluten-free), DF (dairy-free), NF (nut-free) buttons or icons that typically accompany recipe pages these days. Although I understand wanting to organize recipes based on people’s preference or dietary restrictions, I wanted to offer a different perspective on how we decide what to eat or what to cook. 
            </p>
            <p> Recipes here are organized by season. I want to encourage you to make a recipe your own, substitute non-dairy milk for dairy milk, or gluten-free bread for regular bread, but concentrate on eating with nature in mind. Make the food decisions that you like while embracing produce for that time of year. You may be lucky enough to live in a place where you have easy access to what you want when you want it, year-round, with no problem. But is that way of approaching our food purchases and our dish selections really what is best for us and the world? We should aim to eat seasonally. Let’s talk about why:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Eating seasonally offers many health benefits.</strong> It gives us an opportunity to eat different fruit and veggies over the course of a year, and provides insurance that we will <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/">eat the rainbow</a>, as they say. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27110483/">Diversity in the quality of our diets</a> is not only a safeguard to providing the nutrients we need but it is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vy4cpMGZ3Y&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=GutMicrobiotaNewsWatch">major benefit to our gut health</a>. Having a healthy gut or microbiome has been associated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5541232/">strong immune system</a>, <a href="https://pmj.bmj.com/content/92/1087/286.long">weight maintenance, blood sugar control</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26616538/">heart health</a>, in addition to a well-functioning digestive system. 
            </p>

            <img src="./images/recipes-by-season.jpg">

            <p>Also, eating seasonally (or rather locally) can offer us the health benefit of purchasing from farms who avoid using pesticides as a growing method. Many pesticides have been proven to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00148/full">have harmful effects to our health</a>, overtime the increased exposure can become problematic. Our best defense is to purchase from growers who are upfront about their practices and avoid using these chemicals on their products. These chemicals not only hurt us but they also hurt our earth. 

            </p>
            <p>
              By humans interfering with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pesqtODu_XM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=KissTheGround">nature of soil</a> and food production with man-made chemicals, although it helped us produce large quantities of certain crops, it also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5qLlpvv7sk&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=DiverfarmingH2020">disturbed our ecosystem in a way that is becoming more and more difficult to resolve and overcome</a>. Pesticides and herbicides are seeping into our water, air, and ground, destroying some of our great natural barriers to an unhealthy planet and life.
            </p>
             <p>So what can we do?</p> 
        <p>
          <strong>Purchase from local small farms and choose to eat foods that match the season.</strong> By buying your produce at a farmer’s market or through a CSA, and now with even more options such as online or farm boxes from local grocers and restaurants, you can develop relationships with your providers. Learn more about the food you are eating, how it got to your plate, when and how it was grown. Because this all matters when it comes to a healthy planet and lifestyle. 

        </p>
        <p>
          The wins go even further!
        </p>
        <p>
          By purchasing from these suppliers not only are you encouraging <a href="https://foodtechconnect.com/2019/02/21/the-future-of-farming-must-be-biodiverse-says-national-young-farmers-coalition/"> biodiverse farming practices</a> that we know are more sustainable, but you can also support the small farms <a href="https://blog.acton.org/archives/103041-why-farm-subsidies-hurt-small-farmers.html"> who do not rely on government subsidies</a> and may rely solely on what they can sell. <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/06/01/millions-of-dollars-heading-to-farmers-but-small-farms-wont-see-much-of-it/">Now more than ever they need our economic support.</a> Our society needs this support. The <a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/1/25/18197352/american-farming-racism-us-agriculture-history"> small farms owned by African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans, and other marginalized groups,</a> have been historically placed at a disadvantage and subject to discrimation within our food systems to this day. <strong>We should be mindful of who we are buying from, and work to create a more just food system that recognizes all those who contribute to making us and our planet healthier.</strong> To learn more, resources can be found <a href="https://foodtechconnect.com/2020/06/29/food-ag-anti-racism-resources-black-food-farm-businesses-to-support/?mc_cid=1405c633a6&mc_eid=2fc95422af">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to end by sharing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-truly-worth-celebrating-11604596462">this article</a> by Kathleen Squires from the Wall Street Journal in early November 2020 that highlighted Comfort Farm in Georgia, that raises turkeys. The message aligns with much of what was discussed here and gives a more personal example of the importance of knowing your food and it’s providers.

            <p>
              
              Let me introduce myself and give context to what you will see here. 

            </p>
            <p> I have been working and studying in the field of nutrition for over 10 years, and am now a Registered Dietitian. I became interested in nutrition and health as a teenager, who was slightly overweight. What I learned as a kid trying to lose weight and look like everyone else, was that I was missing an understanding of health and how what we eat is more than just about being skinny or having the “instagram perfect body”, it’s about building a positive relationship with our body, our food, and understanding how what we eat has the power to impact not only our own health, but the plant’s health, and the health of society. </p>

            <p>My goal here is to share recipes and thoughts, as well as my expertise on food and health. I have learned a lot on my journey to a healthier, sustainable lifestyle about loving what you eat and what you look like. I hope to be able to educate and inspire others to enjoy their food again! 
            </p>

            <img src="./images/getting-started.jpg">

            <p>I am often confronted with questions like “I eat white rice and white pasta, is that okay?” or “what do you think of juicing?”. And my answers always start with “it depends…” I can’t even imagine how frustrating that answer is. I know that people are looking for a straightforward, “yes or no” answer, or a “good or bad” answer. But that is mostly not how it works. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This feels relevant to mention around this time of year. It is the season of Jewish Holidays as well as my birthday, and it is usually the time of year that I reconnect with many of my friends and family after the summer. Not only is food a staple part of the Fall season (apples and pumpkins galore!) but it is the season of celebrations in Jewish culture full of big meals and hearty menus. And with Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, not too far away, I find food and diet questions pop up more than usual in the Fall.

            </p>
             <p>Asking questions about food and diet is not fruitless (pun intended!). It is a good place to start, and it signifies that someone is at least curious about what they are putting in their bodies for sustenance. And before moving forward, I want to emphasize that our diets should not be confusing or full of restrictive rules. We should love what we eat and look forward to our meals and snacks. So instead of asking questions like “is this food good or bad?”, we could be asking “where does this fit into my diet?”, because it is a food that I like and I want to keep eating it. Simply reframing a question can lead to more optimistic and rewarding discourse around food.
</p> 
        <p>
Here’s my question for today: How can I partake fully in celebrations that come at this time of year and all of the delicious goodies in Autumn without sacrificing health? 
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When we know our day or week is going to include a large meal or meals, or our day is going to end with a bucket full of candy, we can plan ahead. I don’t mean meal planning. I mean balance. Typically we may eat 3 meals a day or 5 small meals, and they are usually balanced out in size. But if we know that one of those will be larger in size than usual, we can plan for it. When the time comes to face the impending large meal or bucket of candy, it’s prudent not to deprive yourself of something you want - this may lead to poor results later - instead, try eating a smaller portion just to satisfy the taste you are craving. Become a mindful eater. Don’t eat on impulse or on emotion. <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide#intro"> Research shows that eating slowly or simply paying attention to what we put on our plates, is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</a></li>
<li>It’s tough to plan a menu. I know I tend to get writer’s block just as I am being asked to plan a meal….great timing. But the best part of autumn is all the wonderful produce in season during this time, making it fun and exciting to eat what nature is asking us to. Explore your local farmer’s market, the pumpkin, squash, apples, colorful potatoes, brussel sprouts, and more! As the growing season comes to a close, so do some farmer’s markets. But that does not mean we need to resort to the supermarket. We can still choose to eat from local sources by joining a CSA or finding local grocers or buying farm boxes from restaurants and online grocers. Being conscious of the environmental impact our food system has on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25027288/">biodiversity, pollution, water and land use, and soil degradation can be reflected in what we choose to eat.</a> 
</li>
<li>
  I recently read an article in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/dining/restaurant-servers-coronavirus.html"> NY Times, by Peter Wells</a>, about the uptick in dining out as we have been able to return to restaurants, indoors and outdoors. The article emphasizes how we need to remember and be conscious of all the people that work to make that possible. We tend to take for granted the privilege of eating in a restaurant, and the pandemic made us wake up to this privilege. Not only are staff taking risks to be there as servers and cooks, but they are also providing an essential service to give us a sense of normalcy in difficult times. A healthy society is about respecting and appreciating those around us, in all circumstances. We are coming up on the season of thanks and for those in the Jewish community we are beginning a new year, turning over a new leaf, so when it comes to where we eat, how we eat, and who makes that possible, pay attention and be grateful.
